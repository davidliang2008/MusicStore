# MusicStore
A lightweight sample store application that sells music albums online: multiple tiers, 
ASP.NET MVC 5, Entity Framework, etc.

Please refer https://github.com/davidliang2008/MusicStore/wiki for what we talked about 
during each class.

## Notes
* Don't download/clone the solution into your machine and use it as your project:
    * I want each of you to build your own solution with projects. Hence I name the solution
        as __[YOUR INITIALS]__.MusicStore, i.e., DL.MusicStore
    * You can still refer to this Github repository to find out what codes you miss
